      <h2 class="text-2xl">Last night I was thinking in my bed. Why is it that when life feels heavy, when I am sad and down, I always find refuge in sad music?</h2>


      <section itemprop="articleBody" class="space-y-4">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-yellow-400 mt-6">Why Sad Songs Heal Us More Than Happy Songs</h2>
      
        <p>Why is it that instead of scrolling and searching through cheerful and upbeat music on Spotify, you know, to at least lift my mood, I always end up searching <em>"Adele"</em>, or Tate McRae's <em>you broke me first</em>?</p>
      
        <p>You'd think that it's the most logical thing to do because happy music is supposed to cheer you up, right? That's what you need at that exact moment, right? But still, even at your lowest, you always go looking for songs that feel like they've carried a lifetime of storms. Why?</p>
      
        <p>The truth is, you are not the only one who feels like this. No. A lot of us, including myself, feel like it is always the sad songs that carry me through the hard times, the heartbreaks and yes, even the pain.</p>
      
        <p>The problem with happy songs when you are sad, is that they feel like that uninvited guest that has "impeccable timing"; always showing up, knocking at your door when you just want to be left alone. Whereas, a sad song feels like that friend who’s always there in your time of need and pain. Not advising you. Not trying to cheer you up. Not trying to fix you. Just sits there with you. Feeling your pain with you and assuring you, even without words, that "you are not alone in this", or "I understand, I've been there too."</p>
      
        <p>So, here is the answer that brought you to this article in the first place. The truth is there is healing in recognition. What do I mean? In knowing that someone else has felt and gone through the same cracks and the same hollow nights you are, makes the pain a little lesser; if that makes sense. That’s what sad songs do. They give our pain a mirror, of some sort. You know, a way to see and discover ourselves more clearly. What this does is, it transforms the loneliness, the pain that we feel, into connection.</p>
      
        <p>And here is the paradox. By sad music creating an environment of sorrow, which correlates with our current emotions, it makes it feel like we are in a safe space. A place where you can feel a little bit more understood, and a little bit less judged. And that is also why we find ourselves crying in the process of listening to that 3-minute song. This helps because it makes us release the grief and the sorrow that we wouldn't have otherwise done, had we been listening to a funky playlist. And honestly speaking, or writing in this case, that one tear shed in that three-minute song, helps us heal a bit faster than weeks if not months of silence. I'll stop there because I think you all know where I'm heading; the "time heals all wounds" guys...</p>
      
        <p>Anyway. To summarize. Sad songs do not just merely take away or rather erase the pain and the sorrow we feel, no. They give those gloomy emotions a voice. This way they are able to come out easily, quietly, and felt. Which helps in resolving the conflict between them and our human nature of trying to fight what we actually feel.</p>
      
        <p>Maybe that's the reason why we keep coming to them, even long after we've healed. Not to open healed wounds, or simply because we are sadists, no! It's because it reminds us of where we've been and that we were never there alone.</p>
      
        <p>This is what I truly believe. May the music continue to <em>Speak to you</em>.</p>
