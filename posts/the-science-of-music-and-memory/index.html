        <p>I know, it's weird but herein lies the truth. There's a kind of magic in some songs that just lingers even decades later. You hear one note, or one lyric, and boom. You're back to when you first listened to the song, back to that childhood bedroom, lying on the floor with your headphones pressed tight against your ears. Or maybe you’re in the backseat of an old car, window closed, it's raining, the chill of the night still in the air, but you're still warm, while the stereo hums with the soundtrack of those melodies. The melodies that have been stuck in your head to this very day. Just for the record, I did not describe a long time ago memory of mine.</p>

        <p>Anyway, despite the time in between, though it's been forever since you last listened or sang to that particular song, somehow, you still remember the lyrics, word for word.</p>
      
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-yellow-400 mt-6">Music and the Brain</h2>
        <p>I won't lie to you, I didn't exactly pass in biology, but from what I found, it’s that music is not processed the same as any other sound you hear. I won't exactly get into the biological terms, because I'll just flat out embarrass myself, but the concept is somewhat simple. Music talks to the parts of your brain that remember things and feel feelings. So when you hear a song, it can make you remember something that happened before and make you feel the same way you felt back then. Which means you are likely to remember a song more if you resonate with it. That’s why couples have “their song,” why a breakup has its playlist, and why certain choruses can make your chest ache like it did the first time. And that is also why songs sound different for everybody. But if you share a common feeling, and a particular song brings that out, it will pretty much sound and mean the same to different people.</p>
      
        <p>Now, don't get me wrong. It doesn't necessarily mean that a song must resonate with something from your past for it to make sense to you, no. It also depends on how and what the song makes you feel at that exact moment. That feeling you get when you hear the song for the first time — yeah, your brain catches that, if it's good enough of course.</p>
      
        <p>So, keeping this in mind 👇</p>
      
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-yellow-400 mt-6">Why Do Some Songs Stick</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Emotion anchors Memory:</strong> Meaning, the more intense the feeling was/is when you heard the song, the stronger it bonds with your memory.</li>
          <li><strong>Repetition = Permanence:</strong> Meaning, the more you listen to a particular song (which means you love it, by the way), the more you're telling your brain that this song is important and that it means something to me. Keep it somewhere safe.</li>
          <li><strong>Lyrics vs. Experiences:</strong> We all know that words carry weight. I mean, you're reading this article and you're most probably believing everything that I've written, yet you don't even know me. What I mean to say is, if the words sung in a song go hand in hand with the experiences you've had in life, there is no getting rid of it.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-yellow-400 mt-6">A Forever Soundtrack</h2>
        <p>The truth is, not every song, no matter how good it is, is meant to last. It might go viral and be known by almost everyone in every corner of the world, but it's only for a season. Eventually, it wears out and dies down. It's not once we've found a good viral song eventually irritating people. But, there will never lack that one song that defies both time and space. Even if it does not go viral, it remains, and it speaks to someone even beyond time. I know most of you understand what I am saying, because this is something almost everyone has experienced, but if you haven't, I really do pray and hope you find that song(s) that does indeed speak to you.</p>
